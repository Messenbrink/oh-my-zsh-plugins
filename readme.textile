This repo contains some useful plugins for oh-my-zsh.

h2. Plugins

h3. nginx

For now, this is the only one.
It defines @en@ and @dis@ commands for enabling/disabling sites.
It also has completition for these actions. It completes the argument from listing the sites-available (when @en@ is used) and the sites-enabled (when @dis@ is used).
It only works, if @debian@ plugin is activated, because this plugin relies on the @$use_sudo@ variable, which is defined in the @debian@ plugin.

h2. Future plans

Extend the nginx plugin to be able to generate config files for sites and a given user.
Create a php-fpm plugin which is able to create pools for a given user.
