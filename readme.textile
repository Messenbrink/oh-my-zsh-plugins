This repo contains some useful plugins for oh-my-zsh.

h2. Plugins

h3. nginx

For now, this is the only one.
It defines @en@ and @dis@ commands for enabling/disabling sites.
It also has completition for these actions. It completes the argument from listing the sites-available (when @en@ is used) and the sites-enabled (when @dis@ is used).
It only works, if @debian@ plugin is activated, because this plugin relies on the @$use_sudo@ variable, which is defined in the @debian@ plugin.

It also defines the @vhost@ command, which can generate virtualhost config files based on a template. This template can be easily customized setting the NGINX_VHOST_TEMPLATE variable to point to your own template file. Inside that template you can use @user, vhost and pool_id@ variables like this: @root /home/{user}/www/{vhost}/web;@
The @pool_id@ is for php-fpm pools. It's a port, actually. It is calculated by adding 10000 to the users id. You should have a pool listening on this port.
The @vhost@ command accepts a few arguments, type @vhost -h@ to display help.


h2. Future plans

Extend the nginx plugin to be able to completely remove a virtualhost.
Create a php-fpm plugin which is able to create pools for a given user.
